/**
 * Represents an active thread-local mock of a singleton instance. The mocking only affects the thread
 * on which {@link Mockito#mockSingleton(Object)} was called, and it is not safe to use this object from another
 * thread. The singleton mock is released when this object's {@link #close()} method
 * is invoked. If this object is never closed, the mock will remain active on the
 * initiating thread. It is therefore recommended to create this object within a try-with-resources
 * statement.
 * <p>
 * Stubbing and verification on the instance can be done using the standard Mockito APIs.

 * @see Mockito#mockSingleton(Object)
 * @param <T> The type of the singleton being mocked.
